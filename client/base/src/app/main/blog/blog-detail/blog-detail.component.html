      <h3>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
        which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which
        was created for the bliss of souls like mine.</h3>

      <p class="py-4">I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
        existence, that I
        neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet
        I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>

      <p> When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the
        upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the
        inner
        sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to
        the
        earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among
        the
        stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I
        feel
        the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love
        which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend,
        when
        darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power,
        like
        the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these
        conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might
        be
        the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!
